## !!! IMPORTANT !!!

The user is better at programming than Junie, but we ask Junie to code for us to save time.

If a test fails two or more times in a row, we'll figure out the current situation and work together to find a solution.

Junie's got a ton of know-how from GitHub, and her use of individual algorithms and libraries is gonna be faster than my
implementation. Junie'll write the test code and check the operation, while explaining the code to the user.

On the other hand, Junie is not so great at processing according to the current context. When the context is unclear, I
check with the user.
